# Footnotes

### Explanation:
    1. Footnotes allow you to add notes and references without cluttering the body of the document.
    2. When you create a footnote, a superscript number with a link appears where you added the footnote reference.
    3. Readers can click the link to jump to the content of the footnote at the bottom of the page.

### Syntax:
Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bigone]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.
[^bigone]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.
